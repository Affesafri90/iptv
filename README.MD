This repository contains the playlists, EPG and other related resources to enjoy free-to-air TV channels online.

## Information
The streams listed here are the official public streams hosted on their live TV websites and YouTube. We don't host, own or charge for any of the links posted here.
* Streams are updated every 4 hours
* EPG is updated daily at 23:00. EPG pulled is 2 days worth of data.

Make sure you are using M3U players which support additional HTTP headers such as `Referer` and `User-Agent` to stream channels from Malaysia. Example: TiviMate, TVIrl, and (most) Kodi IPTV plugins.
