    <desc lang="en">A music variety where a number of talented singers, amateur or otherwise are given the chance to "challenge" a celebrity tutor by singing one of the celebrity's songs. In exchange, the celebrity is assigned one of four randomly selected songs and has three hours to come up with a cover performance of this song.  与上季相同，基本模式为星素挑战，由追梦歌手对导师发起讨教（挑战）。但在第三季开始，选歌模式已经更换为第一季的模式，可是选择权是由参赛者说“开始”的时候，只要喊“停”，那一首歌曲就是讨教老师要唱的歌。和第一季不一样的是，每一首歌都有关键词。如果进行第二轮讨教，是没有任何的关键词。时间也从之前的6个小时改成3个小时。据华少声称，如果“惊”曲榜里的歌曲原唱者是导师的话，讨教歌手若是选择原唱者导师，将会带来的难度和风险更大，最终导致讨教失败。这一季的歌手包括林俊杰，王嘉尔，胡彦斌，张靓颖，谭维维 等。.</desc>
