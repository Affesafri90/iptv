Unfortunately, the article blows over a prison wall and into a yard where The Mechanic learns of the news.    This prompts him to accelerate the timeline for a prison escape he has been planning with Ultra-Violet. They tunnel into the walls behind Kryptarium, where they are coincidentally joined by Fugi-Dove, another inmate who has been planning his own escape. As the three criminals make their way out of Kryptarium Prison, they tell tall tales of their own captures and argue over which of the ninja is the worst. They finally escape, only to be recaptured by Pixal, whom they all conclude is the 'worst ninja of all.'.</desc>

He makes a house rule: if he can't eat, no one can. Luckily, Jerry and Spike have a stockpile - no skin off their backs. Tom, on the other hand, is not so lucky. With the cupboards and refrigerator padlocked shut, the overly dramatic cat is left to survive the long cold night on the brink of starvation. That's when he invites Little Quacker for a sleepover and Jerry's plan for a quiet night turns ugly. Little Quacker is tired of being the nice duck and between Jerry and Little Quacker, Tom's got his work cut out for him. In the end, Rick has his dates wrong and Tom will have to go through this all over again next week.</desc>

Reaching lengths of 10 feet and weights of over 300 pounds, the Alligator Gar has long been intertwined with Cajun culture, garnering a fearsome reputation as an aggressive apex predator because of its crocodilian snout and sharp teeth. Starting his journey in Louisiana, Carter tracks down some legends locals say still haunt the rivers and bayous and learns there's much more than meets the eye to these prehistoric fish. Following leads from Cajun Country into Texas, Carter searches for giant gar in Texan waterways some say still house the biggest gar in the United States.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This isn't Wakanda. Deep in south India is a jungle kingdom that has inspired legends. Kabini, in the Nagarhole Tiger Reserve, is home to a rogue confederation of animal tribes all vying for territory, power and resources. Now a new king, Saya, is on the rise. He is the only black panther in this jungle. Lineage doesn't favor him, but he's got cunning and grit - and he plans to claim Kabini as his kingdom. From internal struggles for power to a cast reminiscent of 'The Jungle Book,' 'Rise of the Black Panther' transports you to the heart of this jungle kingdom. All hail the new king!</desc>
