    <desc lang="en">The world's biggest beasts have always captured the imagination. But whilst being big can have its advantages, it also comes with sizeable challenges. Take the world's largest lizard, the Komodo dragon, whose huge appetite means it must take on prey ten times its weight, or the tallest animal of them all - the giraffe - who, with such a long neck, must control immense blood pressure. Nature's biggest beasts must go to extraordinary lengths to thrive. These are their epic survival stories!</desc>

As a pianist her influence is jazz, but as a singer-songwriter she sits firmly in the country tradition of Hank Williams and Willie Nelson. Only the wonderful version of Cold Cold Heart on Norah Jones first album betrayed the country roots of this highly-gifted musician.</desc>
