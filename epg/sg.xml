    <title lang="en">幸福方程式 The Joymakers - EP 4</title>
    <desc lang="en">Japan is an affluent society, which is why the issue of poverty often overlooked. In Osaka, there was an unfortunate incident where a mother and child starved to death at home. Determined to help the poor, a few monks decided to establish an anti-poverty organization that distributes temple offerings as gifts to families-in-need, providing them hope and bringing joy.  日本虽然是个富裕的社会，但是正因为贫穷问题不明显，挨饿的人往往更容易被忽略和遗忘。大阪就曾发生母子困在家中活活饿死的事件。一些僧侣为此发起了一个救贫组织，将庙宇的供品转送给贫穷家庭作礼物，带给他们欢乐。僧侣和志工们奔波忙碌，一起尝到助人为快乐之本的味道，也体验了幸福的真谛。.</desc>
